# Machine Learning Cheatsheet #1

### Terminology

#### Machine Learning 
A field of computer science where the computer is given data from the user to learn and recognize patterns to make predictions given user input. 

#### Neural Networks
A computer system consisting of a set of neurons, called layers, that connect to other neurons, to model the function of the human brain. 

#### Weights and Biases

Interchangable parameters of a neural network. These values are generally calculated before the activation function is applied to the neuron.

#### Loss

The "amount of wrong" the neural network has while it trains on user-given data.

#### Cost Function

(can be referred to loss functions as well) A mathematical function to calculate how well the neural network has trained given the data.

#### Optimizer

A function to improve the performance of the neural network by adjusting parametters of the neural network. 

#### Overfitting

When the neural network learns from the data well, but lacks generalizaiton (ability to learn from new data). This generally happens when the neural network is too complex.

#### Underfiting

When the neural network fails to learn from the data well, and lacks generalization.
